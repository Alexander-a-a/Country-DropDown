# Country Generator Web App

⚠️ **Note:** This project is currently not working due to issues with the external country API.

## What it should do

- Let users select continents.
- Generate a random country from the selected regions.
- Show the country’s name, flag, capital, population, etc.
- If only Antarctica is selected, show a custom penguin image instead.
